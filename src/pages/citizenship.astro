              The Argentina Golden Visa: A Two-Year Path to Citizenship
            </h2>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The <strong class="font-normal text-charcoal">Argentina Golden Visa</strong> is the common name for Argentina’s path from legal residency to citizenship. Unlike many countries that require five to ten years of residence, Argentina allows you to apply for citizenship after two years of legal residency. There is no separate “golden visa” law; the term refers to this fast track: obtain temporary residency (through investment, retirement, or passive income), convert to permanent residency when eligible, and after two years of residency apply for citizenship. The outcome is one of the most valuable passports in the Americas, dual citizenship allowed, and access to Mercosur and visa-free travel to 170+ countries.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Argentine citizenship gives you full rights to live, work, and own property in Argentina, plus visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to the European Union, the United Kingdom, and most of Latin America. Argentina permits dual citizenship, so you keep your existing nationality. Below we outline the exact pathway from temporary to permanent residency to citizenship, the timeline and milestones, document requirements at each stage, dual citizenship rules, benefits (including passport strength and Mercosur), and common pitfalls to avoid.

        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl md:text-4xl font-light text-charcoal mb-8">
          From Temporary Residency to Citizenship
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-10">
          The Argentina Golden Visa path has three clear stages. Understanding each stage helps you plan and avoid gaps that can delay or jeopardize your citizenship application.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-2xl font-light text-charcoal mb-4">Stage 1: Temporary Residency</h3>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You first obtain temporary residency (residencia temporal) through one of the routes recognized by Migraciones: investor (Inversionista), retiree (Pensionado), rentista (passive income), or other categories such as family reunification or employment. You apply at an Argentine consulate abroad or at the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones if you are already in Argentina. Approval typically takes a few months. You receive a temporary DNI (Documento Nacional de Identidad) and must comply with the conditions of your visa (e.g. maintaining the investment or proving pension income). Temporary residency is usually granted for one to three years and can be renewed. This period counts toward the two years required for citizenship eligibility only once you have upgraded to permanent residency; some interpretations allow counting from the start of temporary residency—confirm with Migraciones or your lawyer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-2xl font-light text-charcoal mb-4">Stage 2: Permanent Residency</h3>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          After holding temporary residency for the required period (often three years for investor and similar categories, though rules can vary), you apply for permanent residency (residencia permanente). You submit updated documentation proving you have met the conditions of your temporary visa and have not breached immigration or criminal rules. Once permanent residency is granted, you receive a permanent DNI. There is no annual cap on permanent residency; the main requirement is having fulfilled the temporary-residency period and continuing to meet the criteria Migraciones applies at the time of your application. Permanent residency does not expire and allows you to live, work, and study in Argentina without renewing a visa.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-2xl font-light text-charcoal mb-4">Stage 3: Citizenship</h3>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
          After two years of legal residency (interpreted by most courts as two years from the date permanent residency was granted, though some count from the start of temporary residency), you may apply for Argentine citizenship. The application is filed with the federal court (juzgado federal) in your jurisdiction. You must demonstrate continuous residence, basic Spanish, knowledge of Argentine history and the Constitution, and good conduct. The court may request an interview and will verify your documents. Processing can take from several months to over a year depending on the court. Upon approval, you take the oath of allegiance and receive your Argentine citizenship and passport. This is the final step of the Argentina Golden Visa path.

          Dual Citizenship Rules
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Argentina allows dual (and multiple) citizenship. You do not have to renounce your existing nationality when you become Argentine. The Argentine state does not require you to choose one passport over another for most purposes. You can hold an Argentine passport alongside your other passports and use each according to the rules of the country you are entering or leaving.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Your country of origin may have its own rules: some countries restrict or discourage dual citizenship, or require you to inform authorities. It is your responsibility to check whether your home country recognizes dual citizenship and whether you need to declare your Argentine citizenship. Argentina’s position is clear: acquiring Argentine citizenship does not require you to give up another nationality, and losing or renouncing another nationality is not a condition of keeping Argentine citizenship once granted.

            Why Become an Argentine Citizen
          </h2>
          <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-4">
            Argentine citizenship delivers a strong passport, regional mobility through Mercosur, and full rights in Argentina. Below are the main benefits of completing the Argentina Golden Visa path.

        </div>

        <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-12">
          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl font-light text-charcoal mb-4">Passport strength</h3>
          <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Argentine passport offers visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to more than 170 countries and territories. That includes the entire Schengen Area (European Union plus associated states), the United Kingdom, and most of Latin America. For many investors and families, this level of access—obtainable after two years of residency—compares favorably to longer naturalization periods elsewhere. Passport rankings vary by index, but Argentina consistently ranks among the most powerful passports in the Americas.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl font-light text-charcoal mb-4">Mercosur access</h3>
          <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed">
            As an Argentine citizen you are part of Mercosur (Mercado Común del Sur). Mercosur membership allows you to live, work, and study in other member states (Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and associated countries) under simplified rules. That gives you and your family mobility across a large part of South America without needing separate work or residence permits in each country. For business or lifestyle reasons, Mercosur access is a concrete advantage of the Argentina Golden Visa outcome.
