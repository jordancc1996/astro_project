          What to Expect From Day One to Citizenship
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Argentina residency runs in clear stages: you submit an application, complete any required biometrics, receive temporary residency, renew as needed, become eligible for permanent residency, and eventually for citizenship. Each stage has its own timing and paperwork; delays at one step can push back everything that follows. This guide walks through the timeline step by step—application, biometrics, temporary residency approval, first renewal, permanent residency eligibility, and citizenship eligibility—and gives practical tips to avoid delays at each stage. Timelines below are typical for investor, pensionado, and rentista routes; your category and office may vary. Always confirm current procedures with the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones or your legal advisor.

    <!-- Stage 1: Application -->
    <section class="section-padding bg-white">
      <div class="container-luxury max-w-3xl">
        <p class="label-small mb-2">Stage 1</p>
        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl font-light text-charcoal mb-6">
          Application
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You file your residency application either at an Argentine consulate abroad or at the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones if you are already in Argentina on a valid stay. You must choose the correct category (investor, pensionado, rentista, or other) and submit a complete file: passport, birth certificate, criminal clearances from your country of residence and sometimes from Argentina, proof of funds or pension or investment, and any category-specific documents (e.g. investment plan for the investor visa, pension letter for the pensionado). Documents issued abroad usually need to be apostilled or legalized and translated by a certified translator. Missing or incorrect documents are the main cause of delays at this stage.

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm mb-6">
          <li>Request the official checklist from the consulate or Migraciones for your visa type and follow it exactly.</li>
          <li>Order criminal clearances and apostilles early; they can take weeks and some expire (e.g. 90 days).</li>
          <li>Use a certified translator for all non-Spanish documents and keep copies of originals and translations.</li>
          <li>If applying as an investor, have your investment plan and evidence of funds ready before you book an appointment.</li>
          <li>Book the appointment as soon as you have a complete file; consulates and Migraciones can have long wait times.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Stage 2: Biometrics -->
    <section class="section-padding bg-cream-light">

          Biometrics
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Depending on where you apply and the current procedure, you may be asked to provide fingerprints and a photograph (biometrics) as part of the residency process. This can happen at the same time as the application submission, or Migraciones may summon you later. If you applied from abroad, you might complete biometrics at the consulate or after entering Argentina. Failure to attend a biometrics appointment when required can pause your file or lead to a rejection.

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm mb-6">
          <li>Confirm at the time of application whether and when biometrics will be required, and note any deadline in the summons.</li>
          <li>If you are abroad, plan travel to Argentina or to the consulate so you can attend the appointment on the date given.</li>
          <li>Respond promptly to any request for additional information or a new appointment; files can be archived if left inactive.</li>

          Temporary Residency Approval
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Once Migraciones approves your application, you receive temporary residency (residencia temporal). Approval typically takes two to four months from a complete submission, though it can be longer if the office requests additional documents or if there is a backlog. You will be notified to collect your resolution and complete DNI procedures (photo, signature, and issuance of the temporary DNI card). The temporary DNI is your proof of legal residence; you must comply with the conditions of your visa (e.g. maintain the investment or continue to receive the pension) and avoid long absences that could be interpreted as abandonment of residence.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="font-normal text-charcoal">Tips to avoid delays:</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm mb-6">
          <li>Reply quickly to any request for additional documentation; set a calendar reminder to check the status of your file if no response arrives within the expected period.</li>
          <li>As soon as you are notified of approval, book the DNI appointment and attend with the required documents; delays in obtaining the DNI can complicate renewals and travel.</li>
          <li>Keep a copy of the residency resolution and your DNI; you will need them for renewals and for the permanent residency application later.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Stage 4: First renewal -->
    <section class="section-padding bg-cream-light">
      <div class="container-luxury max-w-3xl">

          First Renewal
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Temporary residency is usually granted for one to three years depending on the category and current practice. Before it expires, you must apply for a renewal (prórroga). The renewal process involves submitting updated documentation showing you still meet the conditions of your visa: for example, proof that the investment is still in place, or that you continue to receive the pension or passive income. Migraciones may also request updated criminal clearances. Letting your temporary residency lapse—even by a few days—can create a gap that complicates your timeline and may require you to reapply from scratch or explain the lapse. The first renewal is a good dry run for the documentation you will need for permanent residency later.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="font-normal text-charcoal">Tips to avoid delays:</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm mb-6">
          <li>Note the expiration date on your temporary DNI and start the renewal process at least two to three months before that date.</li>
          <li>Request the renewal checklist from Migraciones and prepare the same type of evidence you used for the initial application, updated to the current date.</li>
          <li>If you are an investor, keep records of the investment (contracts, bank transfers, tax filings) so you can prove continuity at renewal and at permanent residency.</li>
          <li>Submit the renewal application before the expiration date; filing after expiry can be treated as a new application or require extra justification.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Stage 5: Permanent residency eligibility -->
    <section class="section-padding bg-white">

          Permanent Residency Eligibility
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          After you have held temporary residency for the required period (often three years for the investor visa and similar categories; confirm for your category), you become eligible to apply for permanent residency (residencia permanente). You submit an application to Migraciones with proof that you have complied with the conditions of your temporary visa for the full period, that you have not committed serious offences, and that you continue to meet the criteria (e.g. you still have the investment or the pension). Processing can take several months. Once permanent residency is granted, you receive a permanent DNI. The two-year count for citizenship eligibility typically starts from the date permanent residency is granted, not from the start of temporary residency.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="font-normal text-charcoal">Tips to avoid delays:</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm mb-6">
          <li>Apply for permanent residency as soon as you meet the required period of temporary residency; do not wait until your temporary DNI is about to expire.</li>
          <li>Gather proof of continuous compliance (investment records, pension statements, tax filings, utility bills or rental contracts) for the entire temporary period; gaps or missing evidence can slow the review.</li>
          <li>Obtain fresh criminal clearances if requested; use the same apostille and translation standards as for your initial application.</li>
          <li>Keep copies of the permanent residency resolution and the new DNI; you will need them for the citizenship application.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Stage 6: Citizenship eligibility -->

          Citizenship Eligibility
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          After two years of legal residency (generally counted from the date your permanent residency was granted), you may apply for Argentine citizenship. The application is filed with the federal court (juzgado federal) in your jurisdiction. You must demonstrate two years of continuous residence, basic Spanish, knowledge of Argentine history and the Constitution, good conduct (no serious criminal record), and means of support. The court will review your file and may call you for an interview. Processing varies by court and can take from several months to over a year. Upon approval, you take the oath of allegiance and receive your citizenship and passport. Long absences during the two-year period can be interpreted as a break in residence and may lead to denial, so plan travel and keep evidence of your ties to Argentina.
        </p>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="font-normal text-charcoal">Tips to avoid delays:</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm mb-6">
          <li>Do not apply before you have clearly completed two years of permanent residency; early applications can be rejected and may complicate a later filing.</li>
          <li>Keep a clear record of your presence: utility bills, rental contracts, tax filings, bank statements, or other documents the court accepts as proof of residence.</li>
          <li>Prepare for the Spanish and civic-knowledge component; courts can deny citizenship if you do not demonstrate the required level.</li>
          <li>Obtain recent criminal clearances from Argentina and from your country of origin or last residence; use apostilled and translated documents as required by the court.</li>
          <li>File a complete application and respond quickly to any court request for more information; missing documents or slow responses can add months to the process.</li>

          Summary
        </h2>
        <p class="font-sans text-base font-light text-gray-warm leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Argentina residency timeline from application to citizenship typically spans five and a half to seven years: two to four months to temporary residency, then one to three years of temporary status (with at least one renewal), then application for and grant of permanent residency, then two years of permanent residence before you can apply for citizenship, and finally six to eighteen months of citizenship processing. Avoiding delays at each stage—complete applications, timely biometrics, on-time renewals, and a well-documented citizenship file—keeps the process on track. Confirm current requirements and timelines with Migraciones and a qualified advisor before you apply.
